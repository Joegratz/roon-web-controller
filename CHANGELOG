Version 1.1.0
PRE-RELEASE TODO:
- Add volume support
- Complete regression test checklist
- Check for impacts of Roon Server 1.3 (Build 233)
- Complete pre tag / pre release checklist

Done
- Complete rewrite of UI - now supports both Portrait and Landscape view
- Added new theme based on the dominant color of the cover art
- Added controls for Loop, Shuffle, and Auto Radio
- Added a check to see if the extension is enabled
- Added command line option for help and to set the server port ('node app.js -h' for options)
- Added config file for server settings (config/local.json).  Example file "config/local.conf.EXAMPLE" shows usage.  The example file is tracked by "git".  The "config/local.conf" is not tracked by "git" so that local settings will not be clobbered by "git pull".
- Switching zones is now much more responsive
- Tweaked jquery.simplemarquee.js to use "span" instead of "div" due to problems with CSS layouts
